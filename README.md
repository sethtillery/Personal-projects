# Background

Hello!

My name is Seth Tillery and welcome to my project portfolio! Some information about me, I am currently in my junior year at East Carolina University earning my BS in Computer Science with a focus on game development. In my undergraduate studies so far I have encountered a multitude of various coding projects that have each challenged my coding skills. Including making visual ASCII art all the way to a functional airport system. I am also employed at ECU as a tutor for the Computer Science Department, in which I help other students with their code and explain topics that they have trouble understanding. 

Now I currently focus on developing programs for C# and C++ and furthering my game development career and other topics that interest me!
